        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>Terms of Use are a set of rules which the user should follow while using our Website. We have some Tems of Use, which the user should abide to, in all cases. However, we allow exceptions for some cases, as you may see in the <a href="#exception">exceptions list</a><br><br>While
            using our website, you agree to the following:
            <ol>
                <li>You do not have any right to copy our ideas.</li>
                <li>You do not have any right to copy the whole code or any segment of code of this website.</li>
                <li>You do not have any right to duplicate this website.</li>

        <h2>Exceptions</h2>
        <p>MYJ relaxes the Terms of Use for users in some cases. The term each exeption allows to be broken is mentioned by the term number.<br><br>The exceptions are:
            <ol>
                <li>Term 2 can be broken if the programmer is trying to use a section of code for learning. However, this exception limits its usage as it allows the user to only copy and use a section of code and no further. It also cannot be published online
                    without any MYJ reference.</li>
                <li>Term 4 may be broken if the user has permission by MYJ through email only and is mentioned on this page.</li>
                <li>Some terms may be broken if the user is in Selected Permission List.</li>
                <li>All terms may be broken if the user is in Special Permission List.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p><i>Note: Allowing exceptions does not mean the user can break the rules for any reason not mentioned in exceptions. The user must have proof, or must abide to the maximum room provided by exceptions, and must not use an exception as a reason for breaking terms of use in a way that it crosses the boundary of limit provided by exception.</i></p>

    <div id="sl-list">
        <h2>Users Allowed To Break Term 4</h2>
        <p>This are the users granted permission by MYJ to copy one or more of its projects.</p>
        <p style="color: #a5a5a5;"><i>No Data Found</i></p>
        <!-- <ol>
            <li>User</li>
        </ol> -->
        <h2>Selected Permission List</h2>
        <p>This list allows user to break some terms if the user is in this list. However, the user cannot break all terms and can only break the terms which are allowed for him to break in this list.</p>
        <p style="color: #a5a5a5;"><i>No Data Found</i></p>
        <!-- <ol>
            <li>User<br>Can break Term no.</li>

    <div id="sp-list">
        <h2>Special Permission List</h2>
        <p>This list allows user to break all terms if the user is in this list. The user is granted this special permission by MYJ and thus has the full permission to do anything he likes on this website and copy any data. MYJ also contributes with some
            of them and some of MYJ services are their ideas.</p>
